## Article ID: EXT_19-1-2016

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Persistence. As predicted, there was a significant effectof condition on persistence as measured by the durationof work, t(66) = 3.15, p = .002, Cohen’s d = 0.96. Childrenwho handled money worked longer (M = 251.73 s, SD =148.89, 95% confidence interval, or CI = [198.05, 305.41])than children who handled buttons (M = 150.11 s, SD =116.19, 95% CI = [110.8, 189.42]; Fig. 3).2Descriptive statistics fill in the picture. Whereas 12.5%of the children in the money condition (n = 4, 95% CI =[5.0%, 28.1%]) worked until the maximum time limit,none of the children in the neutral condition did (n = 0,95% CI = [0%, 9.6%]), χ2(1, N = 68) = 4.78, p = .029, χ2Yates(1, N = 68) = 2.79, p = .095; Fisher exact test:p = .044.

> Performance. Performance mirrored persistence. Aspredicted, there was a significant effect of condition oncorrect completion of the task, χ2(1, N = 68) = 5.95, p =.015, χ2Yates(1, N = 68) = 4.25, p = .039; Fisher exact test:p = .022. Among the children exposed to money, 21.9%(n = 7, 95% CI = [11%, 38.8%]) correctly completed thelabyrinth; in contrast, only 2.8% of the children in theneutral condition did so (n = 1, 95% CI = [0.5%, 14.2%]).
